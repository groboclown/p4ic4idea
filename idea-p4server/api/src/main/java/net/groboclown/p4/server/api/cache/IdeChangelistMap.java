/**
 * Keeps a mapping between IDE ChangeList objects and Perforce changelist ID objects.
 * This is maintained per-project, and the underlying state must be persisted between
 * executions.
 * <p>
 * The mapping is intentionally simple, and based on the server.  The plugin will store
 * a mapping between the internal IDE changelist key against the Perforce changelist ID.
 * If Perforce has a changelist that isn't stored in the map, a new changelist is created
 * in the IDE, and the link is created.  If a file is moved to an IDE changelist that
 * isn't in the map, then a new Perforce changelist is created, and the link is created.
 * <p>
 * Because of the potential for out-of-sync issues if the file map, update open changes,
 * and update deleted/submitted changes calls, the owner may wish to create temporary versions
 * of the maps, update them, then swap them out as the real versions.
 * <p>
 * Note that multiple Perforce changelists can be associated with a single IDE changelist.
