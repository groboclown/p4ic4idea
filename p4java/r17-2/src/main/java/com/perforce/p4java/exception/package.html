Provides exception and error classes for signaling and handling user, internal, and Perforce server errors.
<p>
P4Java uses a fairly standard set of extensions to java.lang.Exception to signal recoverable errors,
but it also uses extensions to java.lang.Error to signal unrecoverable errors that it's detected itself
(such as null pointers or out-of-range values). Since they're defined as extensions to Error, they're
not typically declared in method &quot;throws&quot; clauses, which means users are free to ignore them in the same
way that they can ignore non-P4Java Error throwables.
<p>
However, if you wish to keep control in the face of all possible errors,
it's probably a good idea to keep an outer catch block for P4JError catching as well as other exceptions
and throwables &mdash; P4Java does not throw such errors lightly, only for conditions that
show a serious programming error (either internally or by the user).
