Perforce's P4Java is a Java-native API for accessing Perforce's SCM services in a Java-natural
and Java-native way.
<p>
P4Java presents Perforce services and Perforce-managed resources and files as first-class Java interfaces,
classes, methods, and objects, rather than as simple strings or command-line-like functions. This approach
reduces the impedance mismatch between Java and Perforce, and makes it easier to integrate the API into
Java applications and tools; it is particularly useful for integrating into model-view-controller (MVC)
contexts and workflows.
<p>
P4Java is aimed mostly at the following types of Java development:
<ul>
<li>
Standalone applications that need to access Perforce services from within the application;
<li>
Plug-ins for Java tools such as Eclipse, ant, cruise control, etc., that need to communicate
with one or more Perforce servers; and,
<li>
J2EE apps, where P4Java can be embedded within a servlet and / or presented as a web service or (e.g.)
an Ajax binding for client-side use.
</ul>
P4Java is aimed at JDK 6 and later environments, but will work with some limitations against a JDK 5 installation
(see the related P4Java User Guide for details)..
