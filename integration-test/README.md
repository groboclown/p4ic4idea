# About

Code to support "integration tests".  Here, that means automation around environment setup to support manual testing
of interesting Perforce server configurations.

This should also include details about manual testing steps that should be run before a release.

The goal is to eventually have this run limited automated tests against these more complex environments.  That will
include heavyweight IDE tests.
