Provides standard implementation classes for the com.perforce.p4java.core interfaces.
Users are free to use implementations defined here for their own purposes, but such use
is not mandatory, and nor should users rely on these implementations always being
returned by the associated interfaces (P4Java reserves the right to change or extend
implementations under the covers).
